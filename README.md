Goal of project:
We designed the first stage (iris tracking) of a gaze tracking system. The purpose of this project was to design a 
system which would allow my nephew Caleb, who is special needs, the ability to control a computer. Other eye tracking 
technologies exist which allow Caleb to control a computer, but they are difficult to setup and uncomfortable. Our eye 
tracking system will use a camera to track eye movement. The setup of the eye tracking system will be as simple as pressing 
a button.The end goal of the system will be to create a simple means by which my nephew can enjoy the use of a computer.

Functional Description (What does it do?):
Using an IR sensitive Camera, Python, and OpenCV, we are tracking the head, eye region, and iris center.
